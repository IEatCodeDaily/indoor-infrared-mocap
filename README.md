# Infrared Indoor Localization

> **Warning**: This is an ongoing project. Many functionalities are still under development and may not be fully operational.

An indoor localization system initially design for drone swarm using infrared on a multi-camera setup. It uses the outside in approach to localize each objects within the detection area.

# Setup Guide
1. Install opencv with SFM and CUDA by following the README guide in `opencv_build/` directory. (Non SFM opencv support will be implemented later. you might not need to do this step anymore)
2. Go wild, nothing is implemented properly yet. everything is in the sandbox.
